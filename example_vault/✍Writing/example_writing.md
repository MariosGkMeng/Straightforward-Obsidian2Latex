# Adding citations
Command: just mention that link that pertains to the literature file. I use the "p"+"number" naming convention. For example, "p1" would be the first literature file in my vault. 

Example: In [[p1]], we see that... ^ad3b86

# Equations
Both equations and subfigures are written in the form of embedded notes, since they are encoded as notes.
## Writing the equation

Steps:

1. Press ctrl+P, then Quickadd: equation\_block\_single

![[eq__block_Einstein#expr]]

It supports the aligned equations, as seen in [[eq__block_1]].

![[eq__block_1#expr]]
## Referencing the equation
In [[eq__block_Einstein]], we see that...
# Figures
## Adding figures
### No subfigures
![[figure__block_gradient_steps#fig]]

### With subfigures
- âž• Allow user to create more complex configurations
![[figure__block_1#fig]]


## Referencing figures
In [[figure__block_1]], we can notice that...


# Admonition blocks
If you write admonition blocks, they are translated into something similar in latex.
**Example**
```ad-warning
This is a warning
```

```ad-note
This is a note
```


# Code blocks
```python
print("this is a code block")
print("this is another code block")
```

# Cross-reference of section
Check [[example_writing#Adding citations|this section]] about adding citations.

# Assume sections from embedded notes
The sections from embedded notes can assume the hierarchy of the file wherein they are embedded.
```ad-note
Notice in the latex file that the section hierarchy has been modified to adhere to the hierarchy of the file that embeds the note.
```
