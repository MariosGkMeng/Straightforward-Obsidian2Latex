# Adding citations
Command: just mention that link that pertains to the literature file. I use the "p"+"number" naming convention. For example, "p1" would be the first literature file in my vault. 

Example: In [[p1]], we see that... ^ad3b86

# Equations
Both equations and subfigures are written in the form of embedded notes, since they are encoded as notes.
```ad-warning
If you write an equation outside of the designated template in an embedded note, then the conversion will be faulty!
```
## Writing the equation

Steps:

1. Press ctrl+P, then Quickadd: equation\_block\_single

![[eq__block_Einstein#expr]]

It supports the aligned equations, as seen in [[eq__block_1]].

![[eq__block_1#expr]]
## Referencing the equation
In [[eq__block_Einstein]], we see that...
# Figures
## Adding figures
### No subfigures
![[figure__block_gradient_steps#fig]]

### With subfigures
See [[figure__block_1]].


- âž• Allow user to create more complex configurations
![[figure__block_1#fig]]


## Referencing figures
In [[figure__block_1]], we can notice that...


# Admonition blocks
If you write admonition blocks, they are translated into something similar in latex.
**Example**
```ad-warning
This is a warning
```

```ad-note
This is a note
```


# Code blocks
```python
print("this is a code block")
print("this is another code block")
```

# Cross-reference of section
Check [[example_writing#Adding citations|this section]] about adding citations.

# Assume sections from embedded notes
The sections from embedded notes can assume the hierarchy of the file wherein they are embedded.
```ad-note
Notice in the latex file that the section hierarchy has been modified to adhere to the hierarchy of the file that embeds the note.
```

# Latex commands
When there is something niche, or some translation functionality that hasn't been developed yet, you can write a latex command within the code-block functionality of Obsidian, and the translator will not touch it. Use the syntax according to the following example:

```latex
\lipsum[1-4]
```

# Inline code parameterization
Open [[fields_for_report|this note]] to modify the fields and add more.
We used method_1. `=choice([[fields_for_report]].argument_1[0], [[fields_for_report]].argument_1[1], "")` `=choice([[fields_for_report]].idea_1[0], [[fields_for_report]].idea_1[1], "")`
