# How to use
## Prerequisites
1. Have Python 3 installed

## Usage
Go to the jupyter notebook. 

For each user-defined parameter, go to the "PARAMETERS" section, wherein the 'PARS' dictionary is located.

To set the paths for the .md file to be converted, change the `PARS['ðŸ“‚']['markdown-file']` and `PARS['ðŸ“‚']['tex-file']`.
Then, just run all code blocks and VOILA!
