# âž• What it cannot convert (so far)

- [ ] (under dev.) Desirable placement for images
- [ ] Bibliography
- [ ] Equation numbering
- [ ] Bullet lists with indentation of level 5 and above
- [ ] Specific parts of embedded notes (e.g. if the embedded note is "![[note_name# Some note section]]", the script would still paste the entire content of that note)

# How to use
## Prerequisites
1. Have Python 3 installed

## Usage
Go to the jupyter notebook. 

For each user-defined parameter, go to the "PARAMETERS" section, wherein the 'PARS' dictionary is located.

To set the paths for the .md file to be converted, change the `PARS['ðŸ“‚']['markdown-file']` and `PARS['ðŸ“‚']['tex-file']`.
Then, just run all code blocks and VOILA!
