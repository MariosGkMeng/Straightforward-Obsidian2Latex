# Straightforward-Obsidian2Latex
Want to write your documents entirely in Obsidian, and then print them to LateX (e.g., for scientific papers and lab reports)?

This Obsidian to Latex translator is **complete**, straightforward to use, and has no üêÇüí© unnecessary complexity as an end result.

It is the most complete that I have seen among existing ones, since it offers more niche functionalities, such as:
- Correct table conversion
- Unfolding content of embedded notes (other packages I have seen just keep the "![[embedded_note]]" in the final text, when in reality the content of that note should appear in the LateX file)

**Yes**, plugins for Obsidian to Latex already exist, but they have [limitations](#comparisons-to-other-converters) that do not allow the user to write in Obsidian freely. **Yes**, I'd have loved to contribute to those projects, but I don't know Javascript and Typescript.

# üí™ What it can convert (new capabilities regularly added)

- [X] Tables
  - Long tables (tables that can expand to more than 1 pages)
  - Non-long tables
- [X] Internal links (sections and blocks)
- [X] External links
- [X] Sections and subsections
  - [X] Maintain proper hierarchy of sections of the main note when a note with sections is embedded
- [X] Image display (however not yet with desirable placement)
- [X] Bullet lists
- [X] Numbered lists
- [X] References/bibliography
	-  But so far only with my own referencing method
- [X] Embedded notes
	- Inluding section hierarchization (i.e., keeping track on what level of section the embedded note was, thus converting any sections inside it to subsections that adhere to the initial hierarchy
- [X] Equations (although the equations in Obsidian are exactly the same as in Latex)
  - [X] Numbered equations
- [X] Discard of text that is inside comments
- [X] Bold font
- [X] Highlighted font
- [X] Removal of Obsidian Comments
- [X] Specific parts of embedded notes (e.g. if the embedded note is "![[note_name# Some note section]]", the script would still paste the entire content of that note)
- [X] Convertion of codeblocks
- [X] Italic font


# üë®‚Äçüíªüöß What it cannot convert (so far)
## Frequently used functionalities

- [ ] Captions for figures (will use the note-block logic, as in the [Equation Referencing](#Adding-equations))
- [ ] Figure size
- [ ] Graphs in latex plotting environment
- [ ] Table captions (will use the note-block logic, as in the [Equation Referencing](#Adding-equations))
- [ ] Desirable placement for images

## Niche/rarely encountered functionalities
- [X] Discard text inside comments **after** start of a (sub)section
- [ ] Properly convert results from querying commands in Obsidian. This will probably never be achieved with this converter, since it requires to have access to the obsidian dataview and dataviewjs outputs.
- [ ] Convert anything that has to do with dataview, dataviewjs and inline queries
- [ ] Automatic table size manipulation (not even LateX does that itself)
- [ ] Regarding Internal links: add page number next to the cross-reference, in case the document is printed
- [ ] EMOJIS: Latex does not include emojis. Therefore, so far they are replaced by text, however in the future I am considering to convert them to small pictures

# üòÅüîã Strengths
- **Equations**:
	- The equation-referencing system helps reference the equations using the **note-linking** feature, thus allowing perfect **traceability of the equations**. The user can reference the equations in Obsidian and click/hover on their link to view them! See [short video](#video-3) for a quick demonstration.
 		- In addition, if you change the name of the equation, because it is a note, any references to it will be updated! 
- **Fast conversion:** Conversion to LateX is fast when the user allows the program to first find the note paths, log them in a textfile, and then not search for them again (unless moved to another folder, or have their names changed, in which case the tool searches anew within the vault)
- Works seamlessly with **embedded notes**. The benefits of using **embedded notes** are enlisted [here](#embedded-notes)
- Erases Obsidian Comments

# üò• Weaknesses
- Large Obsidian files consume significant RAM (read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/scwg7a/obsidian_is_a_ram_hog/) as to why)
- Equation referencing: so far need to create separate embedded notes that represent equation blocks, since Obsidian itself cannot interact with MathJax well enough to create an equation referencing system
- ‚ö† Direct text replacements are not possible, since we are using embedded notes, therefore those texts that we want to replace are not found in a single document (a solution can implemented, via tracking the links)
	- Need a text replacement tool for the embedded parts!

# ‚Ñπ How to use
## Prerequisites
1. Have Python 3 installed
2. Have Jupyter notebook editor installed (e.g. in Visual Studio Code)
3. Have Obsidian installed
4. Install the following Obsidian plugins
	1. Optional, helps speed up equation referencing: **QuickAdd** (for quick insert of equation blocks)
 	2. Optional, helps write equations very fast: **Quick Latex for Obsidian**

## Usage
Go to the **jupyter notebook**. You only have to deal with that.

You should only change things in "PARAMETERS" section, specifically on the 'PARS' dictionary, which contains all the settings.

### (‚ö† IMPORTANT) üìÅ Set your paths 


To set the paths for the .md file to be converted, inside the `straightforward_Obsidian2Latex.ipynb` file, under "User Parameters" section, change the:
- `PARS['üìÇ']['markdown-file']`
- `PARS['üìÇ']['tex-file']`
- `PARS['üìÇ']['list_paths_notes']` (create that text file in this path as well, otherwise you'll receive an error)
- `PARS['üìÇ']['BIBTEX']`: this is only the name of the bibtex file. By default, it is to be included in the same path as the latex file
- `PARS['üìÇ']['equation_blocks']`: this is the path that contains your equation blocks (see [here](#adding-equations) on how it works). It is meant to speed up the searching, due to the fact that if you have a large vault, it would take time. However, this folder will only be parsed, if the note that contains the equation is not in the list of `PARS['üìÇ']['list_paths_notes']`. 


### ‚ñ∂ ‚ñ∂ HOW TO RUN 
Inside the `straightforward_Obsidian2Latex.ipynb`, after setting your paths, run the code block under the section "Rest of code" and VOILA! Obviously, any code blocks above that have to be run before that!

### Adding equations ("Note-block" logic)
Due to the inherent difficulty of equation numbering in Obsidian (read this [thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/automatic-equation-numbering-latex-math/1325) for details), there is no direct way to number and refer to the equations in Obsidian.

The workaround that I have used requires creation of a separate note wherein only the equation is to be added. The note has to obey a few formatting rules, which can be automated with **QuickAdd**.

The folder that you specify in QuickAdd wherein your equation note/block is to be created must be the same as `PARS['üìÇ']['equation_blocks']`.

#### Formatting rules of the equation note

1. Name: The equations are to be labeled based on the **name** of the note. Therefore, for the code to be able to recognize them easily, I have created a name-based rule. If you wish to name the equation "conversion_law", then the name of the note should be "eq__block_conversion_law". Then, when in your document you refer to this equation, you can simply write "in equation \[\[eq\_\_block\_conversion\_law\]\]", and the final latex text would be "in equation \ref{conversion_law}".
2. Structure: The note has to **only have that equation inside, and nothing else!**. It is recommended that you start with a section "# \%\% expr \%\%" and then add the equation, such that you can embed it like \!\[\[eq\_\_block\_conversion\_law#expr\]\]. That way, the title of the note is not visible, making the obsidian file more readable.
3. Path: use a path of your choosing to put those equations. The reason for this is that in case you have a large vault, the code would have to search for the path of that note within the entire vault. Specifying a path for the equation blocks saves time.


##### Automating the creation of that note based on the formatting rules
Those steps above would normally require manual work, which would be annoying.

A way to automatically create an equation-note with the right format, in the right folder is to use the **QUICKADD** community plugin.

üìΩ The videos below illustrate how it creates those automatic equation notes, reference them, and how it looks in LateX.

### Adding citations
So far, I am using my own system for citations in my Obsidian notes.
Specifically, each time I download a .pdf file that contains an article/book, I name it "62. TitleOfPaperOrBook, YYYY.pdf", where YYYY is the year in the YYYY format, and "62" is the sequence number (i.e., the 62nd article/book I have in that folder). 
Then, I use a note: `[[p62]]` to represent that paper. And now, the conversion works as follows:

Obsidian Text: "In [[p62]], the authors mention that ..."
Latex Text:    "In \cite{p62}, the authors mention that ..."

BUT: as a user, you have to add the BibTex citation manually in your designated BibTex file, and use the "p62" as a name. That Bibtex file should be located in **the same path as `PARS['üìÅ']['tex-file']`**!

I will "relax" this rule soon.

# üü¢ Good Practices in Obsidian
## Embedded notes
Read in the [Obsidian website](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embed+files) for information on **what** they are.

Embedded notes allow us to:
- Make our work modular
	- Reuse notes, i.e., making them repeatable --> no need to manually copy/paste and rewrite things!
 	- Index the content of these notes (with more linked notes and/or tags) that apply only on that note --> doing that helps make the search for this note based on the indexing easier
- Focus on specific small parts of a document, instead of searching it in large stand-alone documents
- Use Obsidian for what it was made: creation of a **knowledge structure**: this means that smaller blocks of information are linked to each other based on their relationships and the meaning that they have to the creator. Therefore, writing a large document without embedded notes would result in you missing out in one of the most important features of Knowledge Management


## Automations and hacks
### Lightning fast Latex equation writing in Obsidian
Install the "Quick Latex for Obsidian" Community plugin. 
You can write **your own** snippets (see video below, wherein I show a few of my own as examples).

üîãüîãüîã This makes equation writing much faster than vanilla LateX, or vanilla Obsidian!

üìΩ see video below on how fast you can write equations!

#### video 4
‚ö† For the equation snippets, don't forget to press the Space key after inserting them (not mentioned in the video)
